# Film Streaming Forecast

## Overview
This project demonstrates a predictive model using Video-On-Demand streaming data to forecast the success of movies early on. It leverages Gradient Boosting Machines and advanced feature engineering techniques.

## Contents
- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook providing insights into the streaming data.
- `NetworkAnalysis(NetflixUS).ipynb`: Notebook focusing on network analysis of Netflix US streaming data.
- `TextRank4Keyword.py`: Python script implementing TextRank algorithm for keyword extraction.
- `model.ipynb`: Main notebook where the predictive model is built and evaluated.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions supporting data processing and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Gradient Boosting Machines**: Utilizes GBM for robust predictive modeling.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Implements sophisticated techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provides a thorough analysis of the streaming data.
- **Network Analysis**: Examines the network structure within the streaming data.
- **TextRank for Keyword Extraction**: Applies TextRank algorithm for extracting keywords from textual data.
